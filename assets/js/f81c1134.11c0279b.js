With new features such as advanced permission controls, log filtering, and direct access to critical data, this version aims to streamline system management and offer better insights for administrators. Additionally, improvements in SEO and code quality ensure a more stable and efficient platform for all users.\\n:::\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## v1.2 Stable - 2024-10-18\\n\\n1. **Optimized various issues to improve user experience**  \\n   Based on user feedback, we fixed several minor UI and interaction issues, further optimized page loading speed and responsiveness, making the system smoother and more stable to use.\\n\\n2. **SEO optimization**  \\n   Adjustments were made to improve search engine optimization (SEO), including optimizing meta tags, keyword settings, URL structure, and site map, enhancing search engine crawling and improving ranking results.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## v1.2 Beta - 2024-10-17\\n\\n1. **Added permission check for `/xxxx/xxxxxx`**  \\n   Implemented enhanced security control for impersonated logins. If the impersonated user has Admin-Dashboard access, the system will deny access to prevent regular users from reaching the admin interface through impersonation. Superadmins (`admin.admin`) are exempted.\\n\\n2. **Fixed issue with incorrect display of \\"recent login times\\"**  \\n   Previously, there was an issue displaying users\u2019 recent login times accurately, especially for GitHub OAuth users. This update corrects the issue, ensuring that all OAuth logins are correctly recorded and displayed.\\n\\n3. **Improved Review Request comparison display**  \\n   A clearer and more intuitive comparison interface has been added for reviewing requests, allowing reviewers to quickly understand changes and reduce potential errors during the approval process.\\n\\n4. **Added the ability to filter logs by URL, start_time, and end_time**  \\n   Users can now filter logs based on specified URLs and time ranges (start_time and end_time), making it easier to locate and analyze log data flexibly.\\n\\n5. **Added copyright label with third-party infringement detection**  \\n   A copyright statement has been added, and third-party agencies will automatically monitor and notify us of any detected copyright infringement, helping us protect our intellectual property rights.\\n\\n6. **Direct access to student/user clubs via Edit Student/Edit User**  \\n   Admins can now directly jump to a student\'s or user\'s club details from the user editing page, streamlining workflows and increasing administrative efficiency.\\n\\n7. **New functionality to view the latest Grade and Behaviour Log (default shows 30 entries)**  \\n   Users can now view the latest grade and behaviour logs in the management interface, with the system defaulting to show the most recent 30 records for quick data access.\\n\\n8. **Updated code standards based on Pylint official guidelines**  \\n   Following the latest Pylint version, we updated our code standards to improve maintainability, readability, and reduce the risk of potential code errors.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## v1.2 Alpha - 2024-10-15\\n\\n1. **Added interface support for Operation_Logs with a new UI design**  \\n   This version adds a new user interface for Operation Logs, allowing administrators to view and manage logs more intuitively. The UI for operation logs has been redesigned to improve overall user experience.\\n\\n2. **Users with UserGroupP.VIEW_USER_ALL can view the last 20 operations, but not detailed request information (privacy requirement)**  \\n   For privacy and security reasons, users with UserGroupP.VIEW_USER_ALL permissions can view a person\'s last 20 operation logs, but detailed request information remains hidden to protect sensitive data.\\n\\n3. **Added functionality to view the last login time of users**  \\n   Administrators can now check the last login time of users, helping track user activity, especially useful for user management and audits.\\n\\n4. **Fixed server logging time being recorded as GMT**  \\n   The system previously defaulted to recording times in GMT, which caused confusion in time displays. This update corrects the issue, ensuring times are displayed according to the user\u2019s local timezone.\\n\\n5. **Database field added to store approval reasons, and rejected requests now show rejection reason**  \\n   To provide more comprehensive approval information, a new field for storing approval reasons has been added to the database. Rejected requests now display the reason for rejection, making it easier for administrators and users to understand the outcome.\\n\\n6. **All requests now display the approver\u2019s ID for tracking (visible on both user and admin sides)**  \\n   Both end users and administrators can now see the approver\'s ID on all requests, aiding in tracing and accountability, thereby enhancing system transparency.\\n\\n7. **Added comparison functionality for ClubInfo modification**  \\n   This update introduces a comparison feature for ClubInfo modifications, enabling administrators to easily view the changes before and after each edit, facilitating more efficient review and management.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## v1.1 Alpha - 2024-10-16\\n\\n1. **Added JS support for `crossorigin`**  \\n   To resolve issues with cross-origin resource requests, we\u2019ve added support for the `crossorigin` attribute in JavaScript. This helps to handle cross-origin resources like images and scripts more effectively, ensuring they load correctly in cross-origin environments.\\n\\n2. **Directly view user\'s clubs from Edit User page**  \\n   Admins can now view the clubs a user belongs to directly from the Edit User page, helping administrators quickly understand a user\'s club associations and simplifying the process.\\n\\n3. **Added `Forgot_password` API and HTML page**  \\n   A `Forgot_password` API and corresponding HTML page have been added to improve user experience. Users can now reset their passwords independently, making account recovery more convenient.\\n\\n4. **Viewing Operation_Logs is now limited to user_id = 1 (superadmin)**  \\n   Operation logs viewing is now restricted to users with `user_id = 1` (superadmin). This allows superadmins to monitor system-wide activities while maintaining security.\\n\\n5. **Disabled other related options when `grade_active` is set to no**  \\n   When administrators select `grade_active` as \\"no,\\" other related grade options are automatically disabled to prevent accidental changes, enhancing form logic and usability.\\n\\n6. **Added failure receipt notification for emails, with automatic notification to admin**  \\n   A failure receipt feature has been added for email sending. If an email fails to deliver, the system automatically sends a notification to the admin, enabling timely action to address the issue."},{"id":"project-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/project-release","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-07-project-release.mdx","title":"UlinkCMS First Release!","description":"We are thrilled to announce the official release of UlinkCMS!","date":"2024-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.15,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Wang","title":"Webmaster - Developer and Algorithm Engineer","url":"https://github.com/Macw07","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/macw-07"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/Macw07","x":"https://x.com/Macw07"},"imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87552695?v=4","key":"macw07"},{"name":"Fengting Fei","title":"Webmaster - Operator and Developer","url":"https://github.com/Fewy-FFT","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/fft"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/Fewy-FFT","x":"https://x.com/FFT"},"imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181807991?v=4","key":"fft"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"project-release","title":"UlinkCMS First Release!","authors":["macw07","fft"],"tags":[]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"UlinkCMS v1.x Changelog","permalink":"/blog/v1.x changelog"}},"content":":::info[Exciting News!]\\nWe are thrilled to announce the **official release** of UlinkCMS!\\n:::\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n<div className=\\"card-container\\">\\n  <div className=\\"card-title\\">Quick Login Interface</div>\\n  <div className=\\"button-container\\">\\n    <a className=\\"custom-button primary\\" href=\\"https://ulinkcms.com/admin-dashboard\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Admin Login</a>\\n    <a className=\\"custom-button secondary\\" href=\\"https://ulinkcms.com/login\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">User Login</a>\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n\\nUlinkCMS (Ulink Club Management System) has officially launched, marking a new era for club administration and management!
